This section covers nested HTML elements. For the purpsoses of this repo, 'nested elements' are defined as either elements with more than one level of nesting, elements with more than a few child elements, or elements that are commonly nested together but are not directly related.

An `<a>` element with an `<img>` element nested inside it, or a `<form>` element with fieldsets or legends and varying inputs nested inside it, both would be included in this section.
