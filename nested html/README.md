This section covers nested HTML tags. For the purpsoses of this repo, 'nested tags' are defined as either tags with more than one level of nesting, tags with more than a few child tags, or tags that are commonly nested together but are not directly related.

An `<a>` tag with an `<img>` tag nested inside it, or a `<form>` tag with fieldsets or legends and varying inputs nested inside it, both would be included in this section.
