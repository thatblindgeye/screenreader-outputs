# Basic HTML Tags

This section covers basic HTML tags. For the purpsoses of this repo, 'basic tags' are defined as either single tags or tags that don't have many nested child tags.

For example, a more complex `<form>` tag would be included in the Nested HTML Tags section, but an `<audio>` tag with a couple of nested `<source>` tags would be included in this section.

## Some quick notes

ARIA Landmark tags are: `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<form>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, and `<section>`. These semantic tags can help screen reader users navigate through a web page. Screen readers may also be able to navigate through a page via other elements, such as traversing through each link on a page or each checkbox on a page.

The `<div>` and `<span>` tags do not have any special announcement from a screen reader on their own.
