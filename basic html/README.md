This section covers basic HTML tags. For the purpsoses of this repo, 'basic tags' are defined as either single tags or tags that don't have many nested child tags.

For example, a more complex `<form>` tag would be included in the Nested HTML Tags section, but an `<audio>` tag with a couple of nested `<source>` tags would be included in this section.
