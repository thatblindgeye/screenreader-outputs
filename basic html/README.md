This section covers basic HTML elements. For the purpsoses of this repo, 'basic elements' are defined as either single elements or elements that don't have many nested child elements.

For example, a more complex `<form>` element would be included in the Nested HTML section, but an `<audio>` element with a couple of nested `<source>` elements would be included in this section.
