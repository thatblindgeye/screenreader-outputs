# Nested HTML Tags

This section covers nested HTML tags. For the purpsoses of this repo, 'nested tags' are defined as either tags with more than one level of nesting, tags with more than a few child tags, or tags that are commonly nested together but are not directly related.

An `<a>` tag with an `<img>` tag nested inside it, or a `<form>` tag with fieldsets or legends and varying inputs nested inside it, both would be included in this section.
