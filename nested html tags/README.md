# Nested HTML Tags

This section covers nested HTML tags. For the purpsoses of this repo, 'nested tags' will be defined as tags that either need to be, or happen to be, nested inside at least one other tag. A group of tags that create a `<form>` would be included in this section, as well as an `<img>` tag inside an `<a>` tag.
