# Nested HTML Tags

This section covers nested HTML tags. For the purpsoses of this repo, 'nested tags' will be defined as either tags with more than one level of nesting, tags with more than a few child tags, or tags that are commonly nested together but are not related.

An `<a>` tag with an `<img>` tag nested inside is considered a set of nested tags that are not related, while a `<form>` tag with several inputs would be considered a tag with more than a few child tags.
