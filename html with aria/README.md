# HTML with ARIA

This section covers tags with various ARIA attributes added. ARIA attributes can help a screen reader announce the correct information to a user. This can range from `<span>` or `<div>` tags being used to create a custom checkbox and giving it the `aria-role="checkbox"` attribute, or making sure a button whose text content is a '+' icon and the text "Book" is announced as "Add book".
