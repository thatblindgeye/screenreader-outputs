# HTML with ARIA

This section covers tags with various ARIA attributes added. ARIA attributes can help a screen reader announce the correct information to a user. This can range from `<span>` or `<div>` tags being used to create a custom checkbox and giving it the `aria-role="checkbox"` attribute, or making sure a `<button>` whose text content is "+ Book" (the plus icon and the word "book") is announced as "Add book".
